1. trid to delete all frames and see no difference
2. installed pip gifparse and modified the program to dump attributes
		recursively.
3. check comments field: don't find any
4. try to do color analysis: all SAME color. Played with global color table
	it's always the same color. No showing of other text info.
5. folow suggestions of : https://medium.com/@FourOctets/ctf-tidbits-part-1-steganography-ea76cc526b40
	(a) file red2.gif -> ok, nothing
	(b) strings red2.gif -> did no find OOO and flag
	(c) exiftool reports 35 frames, 3 colors, 8.7 seconds animation  
	(d) use binwalk to check if there are embeded files, none.
			binwalk -Me red1.gif
	(e) try foremost red1.gif - nothing -> so it's looking like no embeded
		image
	(f) use identify -> this gives more detailed information. Confirmed that
		the entire image is just one color. So the information must be hiding
		somewhere.
	(g) tried stegnosolv does not work (verified one color again).
			35 frames each with different width
6.  tried to line up all location of frames and see if they encode information, failed to see base64 or chars; tried to apply universal decoder dcode, not
working
-------- 05/17/2019 after ---------
7. color table is the way to go, use library python pillow
8. use coding to replace color index with real color
9. extract all frames into local images and save in RGB
10. merge all frames -> found it was indeed octagon and the alphabet is given
11. easy scripting, first test each point is present
12. define bits->idx translation of alphabet 
13. Done! -> OOO{F-NCEN+--NE+++BD+D+++DARV-+-E+++=JJ+DHDL+E+YNDAZRE-}
